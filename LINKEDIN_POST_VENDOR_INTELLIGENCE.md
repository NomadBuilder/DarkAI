## Option 1: Hook with Stat (Recommended)

🚨 **We tracked 129 vendors selling fake IDs and synthetic identities. 42% operate on Telegram.**

Just published our new report mapping the synthetic identity vendor ecosystem—the people selling fake IDs, SSNs, and documents online.

**What we found:**
• 129 active vendors across multiple platforms
• 80 vendors run actual websites (not just Telegram)
• 92 websites analyzed in detail
• 42% of the vendors we found operate on Telegram

**Why this matters:**
These vendors are selling fake documents that enable fraud, identity theft, and financial crimes. Understanding where they operate and how they're connected helps us disrupt these networks.

**The data is public** because transparency helps security teams, law enforcement, and researchers fight back.

## Option 2: Problem-Focused

The synthetic identity vendor ecosystem is larger and more sophisticated than most realize.

Our new Vendor Intelligence Report tracks 129+ active vendors we've identified—and the infrastructure they use to operate.

**What we found in our dataset:**
• 42% of tracked vendors operate on Telegram
• 80 vendors maintain clearnet websites
• Infrastructure analysis reveals shared hosting, CDN, and payment processors
• Enhanced enrichment shows varying operational sophistication levels

**Note:** These findings reflect our discovered dataset. The actual ecosystem is likely larger, with many vendors operating in private channels or using additional security measures.

**The challenge:**
These vendors operate across multiple platforms, use legitimate infrastructure, and adapt quickly. Traditional detection methods miss the connections.

**The solution:**
Comprehensive intelligence gathering—from web scraping to SSL/TLS analysis to NLP—reveals the networks, relationships, and operational patterns that enable these services.

Publicly accessible data for researchers, security teams, and policymakers.

## Option 3: Data-Driven (Short & Punchy)

📊 **New Data: 129 Synthetic Identity Vendors Analyzed**

Just published our Vendor Intelligence Report with comprehensive analysis of vendors we've identified in the synthetic identity ecosystem.

**The numbers (from our dataset):**
• 129 vendors tracked
• 42% operate on Telegram
• 92 domains fully enriched
• Infrastructure clusters identified

**The insight:**
Among tracked vendors, Telegram appears to be a significant distribution channel, but 80 vendors also maintain clearnet infrastructure—revealing operational patterns through shared hosting, CDN, and payment processors.

**Important:** These findings reflect our discovered dataset, not a statistical sample of the entire ecosystem.

**Why it's public:**
Transparency enables better defense. Full report with methodology, data, and analysis available now.

## Option 4: Story-Driven

We spent months tracking fake ID vendors online.

The result? A report mapping 129 active vendors—where they operate, what platforms they use, and how they're connected.

**What surprised us:**
• 42% operate on Telegram, but that's not the full picture
• 80 vendors run actual websites
• Many share the same hosting providers and payment processors
• Some are sophisticated operations, others are more basic

**Why this matters:**
These vendors sell fake documents that enable identity theft and fraud. By understanding their infrastructure—where they host, how they operate—we can help disrupt these networks.

**The data is public** because fighting fraud requires transparency.
