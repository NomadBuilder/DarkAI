                <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Service providers (CDNs, hosts, ISPs) are being paid to enable these sites and should be held accountable, even if they're acting as intermediaries like Cloudflare.</p>
                <p><h2>Executive Summary</h2></p>
<p>This analysis examines infrastructure patterns across 200 domains associated with AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). The data reveals significant concentration of infrastructure services, with several providers enabling disproportionately large numbers of these domains through CDN, hosting, and network services.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Service providers (CDNs, hosts, ISPs) are being paid to enable these sites and should be held accountable, even if they're acting as intermediaries like Cloudflare.</p>
<p><h2>Key Findings</h2></p>
<p>Infrastructure Breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloudflare, Inc.: hosts 37.5% of all domains (75 domains), serves as CDN for 46.0% of domains (92 domains), provides ISP services for 38.0% of domains (76 domains)</li>
<li>Namecheap, Inc. is the registrar for 18.0% of domains (36 domains)</li>
</ul>
<p><h2>Bad Actors Identified</h2></p>
<p>Key Principle: All service providers in the chain (CDN, Host, ISP) are being paid and should be held accountable, including intermediaries like Cloudflare.</p>
